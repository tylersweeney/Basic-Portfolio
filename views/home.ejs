            <p>My name is Tyler Sweeney and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer.
            I began programming in 2015 with Python at Orange Coast College.
            I completed my Full-Stack Web Developer certification in April 2018.
            A gamer since a young age when every game had to be launched from DOS,
            my first interaction with programming was terminal commands.    
            </p>

            <p>In the group projects that I have been a part of, the main area I worked on
            was back-end development. In my free time I have been learning C++ and the Unreal Engine.
            I hope to have a part in making video games, which I have been passionate about my whole life.
            </p>
