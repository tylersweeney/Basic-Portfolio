			<p>
				Hello. My name is Tyler. I have been using computers since before I could walk. Typing in "CD\A: to get to my precious "Reader Rabbit" on the floppy drive before I could write"
			</p>
			<p>
				I am the very model of a modern Major-General,
				I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,
				I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historical
				From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical;a
				I'm very well acquainted, too, with matters mathematical,
				I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,
				About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot o' news, (bothered for a rhyme)
				With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm very good at integral and differential calculus;
				I know the scientific names of beings animalculous:
				In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,
				I am the very model of a modern Major-General.
			</p>
			<p>
				I know our mythic history, King Arthur's and Sir Caradoc's;
				I answer hard acrostics, I've a pretty taste for paradox,
				I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus,
				In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous;
				I can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies,
				I know the croaking chorus from The Frogs of Aristophanes!
				Then I can hum a fugue of which I've heard the music's din afore, (bothered for a rhyme)b
				And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then I can write a washing bill in Babylonic cuneiform,
				And tell you ev'ry detail of Caractacus's uniform:c
				In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,
				I am the very model of a modern Major-General.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, when I know what is meant by "mamelon" and "ravelin",
				When I can tell at sight a Mauser rifle from a javelin,d
				When such affairs as sorties and surprises I'm more wary at,
				And when I know precisely what is meant by "commissariat",
				When I have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery,
				When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery –
				In short, when I've a smattering of elemental strategy – (bothered for a rhyme)
				You'll say a better Major-General has never sat a gee.e
