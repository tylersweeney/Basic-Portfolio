				Hello. My name is Tyler. I have been using computers since before I could walk. Typing in "CD\A: in DOS to load "Reader Rabbit" off of the floppy drive on my dad's beast of a laptop.

				My Grandfather started a company that made exercise machines. This was in the 80's so personal fitness equipment sales were at their height, as they had found success with a stairclimber. My grandfather employed a few in house programmers. I would often go to work with my dad and get set up with all the "Commander Keen" I could play. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I rememeber getting our first home PC. I rememeber my dad being excited about the Intel 486 processor, and how it smoked the 386. Looking it up now, 50MHz seems laughable. But I still feel like we were able to get so much done with so little!
			</p>
			<p>
				So from that point on in the early 90's I always had a hand in helping upgrade computer parts. Until eventually my interest surpassed my dads and now I was the one begging for new parts and components. By High School I'd collected enough to make my own frankenstein PC.

			<p>
				Then I can write a washing bill in Babylonic cuneiform,
				And tell you ev'ry detail of Caractacus's uniform:c
				In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,
				I am the very model of a modern Major-General.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, when I know what is meant by "mamelon" and "ravelin",
				When I can tell at sight a Mauser rifle from a javelin,d
				When such affairs as sorties and surprises I'm more wary at,
				And when I know precisely what is meant by "commissariat",
				When I have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery,
				When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery –
				In short, when I've a smattering of elemental strategy – (bothered for a rhyme)
				You'll say a better Major-General has never sat a gee.e
